_Son -_

_I wish you did live closer._

_A friend of mine was a Senior Vice President at a large oil company. He always thought his father, who was a shop steward at a manufacturing plant in Cleveland, was a failure. His father never attended college and certainly didn't have the salary or title that my friend had. When his dad passed away, over 1000 people attended his funeral. People from all walks of life told stories about what a great guy his dad was, and my friend began to question what it meant to be a success._

_It's not important how many things you acquire while you are here. What's important is to leave this place in a little better condition than how you found it._

_Love -_  
_Dad_

_Dad,_

_I spent the afternoon with a buddy of mine who just lost his father. One of the things he didn't realize about his dad, because he had spent the better part of a decade being away from home, was how much of an impact his father made in the community around him._

_300+ people showed up to the funeral, and all the speakers said the same things about the qualities this man possessed. When I asked my friend what he missed about him the most, he said that he wished he would've spent the past ten years closer to him._

_I really think that when I'm finished with school, and possess a solid tenure with the military and good standing with my employer, I will make my way closer to home in Texas. I love you and hope to talk to you soon!_

_Love -_  
_Julian_
