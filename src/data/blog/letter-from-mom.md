**From:** Mom  
**Date:** December 1, 2024  
**To:** Jason  
**Subject:** Just Because

_Hi Jason,_

_I wanted to take a little time in sending you an email as I have been busy. How are you doing my son? I really appreciated your text today just to tell me that you love me, I love you too. I am so proud of you and your accomplishments, you can do anything you put your mind too._

_We are living in a crazy world now, so much divide. I don't appreciate how we are being forced to live by our government rules, I don't believe God wants it this way and the rule makers will have to answer for it one day. How do you feel about what's taking place in this world?_

_The things that make me happy is watching my children grown into what you are today. I miss hanging out with all of you, the three of us used to have a lot of fun such as our trips to Vegas and Magic Mountain every year on super Bowl Sunday. I will always keep this in my heart and cherish them forever._

_You and Paul turned out to be successful and I give your dad a lot of credit in making sure that you stay educated. Even know both dad and I provided you boys with love and support, dad was really strict when it came to your education. If someone asked me if I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have changed a thing. The reason for this is because I would not have had you boys._

_I would really like to come visit you, we should try to plan for April time frame as I would think the whether would be nice in NC at this time of the year, what do you think of the timing? We would have a blast with you, I enjoyed going fishing and hanging out at your place. Let's make plans for this._

_If you are up for a bible study on Sunday, I would really like this. Please let me know what time works best for you. I'm keeping you in my prayers._

_Love Mom,_  
_xxoo_
